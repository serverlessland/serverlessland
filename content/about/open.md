[ServerlessLand](https://github.com/serverlessland) organization contains the code of cloud functions, infrastructure configuration, and data files.

While I'm working on a better way to cross-link the website pages to the corresponding pieces in source control, here is a plain list of what's available:

- [AWS Lambda functions](https://github.com/serverlessland/aws/tree/master/http)
- [Azure Functions](https://github.com/serverlessland/azure/tree/master/http)
- [Google Cloud Functions](https://github.com/serverlessland/gcp/tree/master/http)
- [Data behind charts](https://github.com/serverlessland/serverlessland/tree/master/data)
- [Raw measurement data](https://github.com/serverlessland/serverlessland/tree/master/data/raw)

Feel free to open a new issue on any of repositories and post your questions or suggestions.
