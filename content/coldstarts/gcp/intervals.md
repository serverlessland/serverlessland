The very first cold start happens when the very first request comes in after deployment. 

After that request is processed, the instance stays alive for the time being to be reused for subsequent requests. But for how long?

The following chart attempts to answer this question. It plots the response duration in seconds (Y-axis) by the interval since the previous requests (X-axis). Each point represents a single request in the data set. Blue points are cold starts and red points are responses from warm instances:

{{< chart_scatter 
    "coldstart_gcp_scatter"
    "Cold and warm latency as a function of interval between two subsequent requests" >}}

This chart looks pretty random: both cold and warm starts are all over the place. An idle instance can be recycled as soon as after **6 minutes** of inactivity, or stay alive for more than **5 hours**.

Most probably, Google makes the decision based on the current demand/supply ratio in the given resource pool.

The following chart estimates the probability of a cold start (Y-axis) by the interval between two subsequent requests (X-axis):

{{< chart_line 
    "coldstart_gcp_interval" 
    "Probability of a cold start happening before minute X" >}}

Don't assume the probabilities on this chart to be precise, but the overall trend should be representative.
